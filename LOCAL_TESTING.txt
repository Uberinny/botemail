# Running Bot Locally (For Testing)

Since the bot token is NOT hardcoded in the script (for security), you need to set it as an environment variable to test locally.

## Windows

### Option 1: Set for current session only
Open Command Prompt in your bot folder:
```cmd
set BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
python discord_bot.py
```

### Option 2: Create a batch file
Create a file named `run_bot.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
set BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
python discord_bot.py
pause
```
Then just double-click `run_bot.bat` to start the bot.

### Option 3: PowerShell
```powershell
$env:BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
python discord_bot.py
```

## Linux / Mac

### Option 1: Set for current session only
Open Terminal in your bot folder:
```bash
export BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
python discord_bot.py
```

### Option 2: Create a shell script
Create a file named `run_bot.sh`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
export BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
python discord_bot.py
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x run_bot.sh
./run_bot.sh
```

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Never commit your token to GitHub!**
- The token is only in environment variables
- Safe to push code to GitHub
- Make repository PRIVATE for extra security

✅ **For Railway deployment:**
- You don't need to do any of this locally
- Just set BOT_TOKEN in Railway Variables
- Railway handles everything automatically

🔒 **Security Best Practice:**
- Token is NOT in the code
- Token is NOT in any files
- Token is only in environment variables or Railway Variables
- This is the secure way to handle secrets!

## Quick Test Flow

1. Set your BOT_TOKEN environment variable (see above)
2. Run: `python discord_bot.py`
3. Should see: "✅ Logged in as YourBotName#1234"
4. Test your commands in Discord
5. When ready, deploy to Railway!
